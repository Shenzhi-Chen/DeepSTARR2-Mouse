## DeepSTARR-Mouse

DeepSTARR-Mouse is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) adapted from the previously published DeepSTARR architecture [(Nature Genetics, 2022)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-022-01048-5). This model is designed for use in a transfer-learning framework to predict enhancer activity in E11.5 mouse embryos. For each tissue, CNNs are pre-trained on DNA accessibility data (i.e., ATAC-seq) and fine-tuned on a limited set of experimentally validated enhancers (VISTA enhancer browser, [https://enhancer.lbl.gov/vista/](https://enhancer.lbl.gov/vista/)).

This repository contains the code used to train the models, make predictions, and design tissue-specific enhancers by [Ledidi](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.22.650035v1).

## Sequence-to-accessibility Model training
Data were used for Sequence-to-accessibility model training are uploaded at Hugging Face: [accessibility_model_dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Shenzhi-Chen/DeepSTARR-Mouse-dataset/accessibility_model_dataset).
To train and evaluate models across 3 cross-validation folds for 3 tissues (heart, limb, and midbrain/CNS), download the `accessibility_model_dataset` and run the following script:
```
Accessibility_model_training/Run_models.sh
```

This script trains 2 replicates for each of the 3 cross-validation folds across the 3 tissues, creating a total of 18 models. For each model, it generates predictions and computes nucleotide contribution scores on the held-out test dataset.

Outputs are saved in separate directories. For example, the output for the heart model from fold 1, replicate 1 is located at:
```
accessibility_model/heart/results_fold01_heart_DeepSTARR_rep1

# Trained model
- Model.json # Model archeticture
- Model.h5 # Trained model weights

# Predictions on held-out test dataset
- fold01_sequences_test.fa_predictions_Model.txt

# Nuceotide contribution score with sequences one-hot code
- fold01_sequences_test_onehot.npz # Sequence one-hot code 
- fold01_sequences_test_contrib.npz # Nucleotide contribution score
- Model_fold01_sequences_test.fa_dinuc_shuffle_deepSHAP_DeepExplainer_importance_scores.h5 # Combined h5 file
```

## Sequence-to-activity Model training
Data were used for Sequence-to-activity model training are uploaded at Hugging Face: [enhancer_activity_models](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Shenzhi-Chen/DeepSTARR-Mouse-dataset/tree/main/enhancer_activity_model_dataset). Data were used for evaluation model are uploaded at Hugging Face: [testing_dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Shenzhi-Chen/DeepSTARR-Mouse-dataset/tree/main/testing_dataset).
To train and evaluate models across 3 cross-validation folds for 3 tissues (heart, limb, and midbrain/CNS), download the `enhancer_activity_model_dataset` and run the following script:
```
Enhancer_activity_model_training/Run_models.sh
```

This script trains 2 replicates for each of the 3 cross-validation folds across the 3 tissues, creating a total of 18 models. For each model, it generates predictions and computes nucleotide contribution scores on the held-out test dataset.

Outputs are saved in separate directories. For example, the output for the heart model from fold 1, replicate 1 is located at:
```
enhancer_activity_model/heart/results_fold01_heart_DeepSTARR_rep1

# Trained model
- Model.json # Model archeticture
- Model.h5 # Trained model weights

# Predictions on held-out test dataset
- fold01_sequences_test.fa_predictions_Model.txt

# Nuceotide contribution score with sequences one-hot code

- fold01_sequences_test_contrib.npz # Nucleotide contribution score
- Model_fold01_sequences_test.fa_dinuc_shuffle_deepSHAP_DeepExplainer_importance_scores.h5 # Combined h5 file
```

## Control model training
To benchmark the performance of transfer learning, we implemented two alternative control strategies:
(i).  **Direct Training:** Models trained directly on annotated VISTA enhancers without a pre-training step.
(ii).  **Accessibility Model Predictions:** Predictions from the sequence-to-accessibility models, which are scaled to a [0, 1] range and used as a proxy for enhancer activity.
To run these control experiments, execute the following script:
```
Model_evaluation/run_control_models.sh
```
(i) The output for a model trained directly on enhancer data (e.g., for heart, fold 1, replicate 1) is saved at:
```
enhancer_activity_model/heart/results_fold01_heart_DeepSTARR_rep1_init_random

# Trained model
- Model.json # Model archeticture
- Model.h5 # Trained model weights

# Predictions on held-out test dataset
- fold01_sequences_test.fa_predictions_Model.txt
```

(ii) The enhancer activity predictions derived from the corresponding sequence-to-accessibility model (e.g., for heart, fold 1, replicate 1) are saved at:
```
accessibility_model/heart/results_fold01_heart_DeepSTARR_rep1/enhancer

# Enhancer predicted activity from the sequence‑to‑accessibility models

```

### Ledidi Tissue-Specific Enhancer Design

This section describes how to design novel tissue-specific enhancers using **Ledidi**, a model-guided gradient optimization approach ([Jacob et al., 2022](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.22.650035v1)).

#### Methodology

The design process starts with 1,200 random DNA sequences for each tissue. These sequences are generated with dinucleotide frequencies matched to known VISTA enhancers to ensure a realistic starting point.

*   **Reference Sequences:** The VISTA sequences used for frequency matching are available on Hugging Face: [testing_dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Shenzhi-Chen/DeepSTARR-Mouse-dataset/tree/main/testing_dataset).

These seed sequences are then optimized using both the sequence-to-accessibility and sequence-to-activity models with the following parameters:
*   **Target Accessibility Score:** 12
*   **Target Activity Score:** 14
*   **Edit Penalty:** `0.1` (to limit the number and magnitude of edits)

For activity optimization, pre-sigmoid logits are used instead of the final sigmoid output to avoid gradient saturation and improve optimization stability.

#### Execution

To run the enhancer design process, execute the following script:
```
Ledidi_enhancer_design/run_ledidi_enhancer_design.sh
```
This script applies all 18 trained models (2 replicates x 3 folds x 3 tissues) to design enhancers. To manage memory, it processes the sequences in batches, generating 20 sequences per model in each of the 10 batches. This results in a total of **1,200 designed sequences** for each tissue.

The designed sequences are saved in separate directories. For example, the output for the heart model from fold 1, replicate 1, batch 1 is located at:
```
ledidi_design/heart/results_fold01_heart_DeepSTARR_rep1/1

# 20 designed tissue specific enhancers
- 1adjusted12_14_designed_sequence_evolution.fasta 
```

## Prediction for new DNA sequences
To predict the accessibility levels or enhancer activity score in a given tissue of the mouse embryo for new DNA sequences, please run:
```
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/Shenzhi-Chen/DeepSTARR-Mouse.git
cd DeepSTARR-Mouse

# download a Sequence-to-accessibility or Sequence-to-activity model from Hugging Face https://huggingface.co/Shenzhi-Chen/DeepSTARR-Mouse
# example with Sequence-to-accessibility model for heart fold01 replicate1 as accessibility_models/heart/results_fold01_heart_DeepSTARR_rep1/Model*

# create 'DeepSTARR' conda environment by running the following:
conda create --name DeepSTARR_Mouse python=3.7 tensorflow=2.4.1 keras=2.4.3 # or tensorflow-gpu/keras-gpu if you are using a GPU
source activate DeepSTARR_Mouse
pip install git+https://github.com/AvantiShri/shap.git@master
pip install 'h5py<3.0.0'
pip install deeplift==0.6.13.0

# Run prediction script on fasta files with 1,001 bp sequences
python Accessibility_model_training/Predict_CNN_model_from_fasta.py \
  -s Sequences_example.fa \
  -m accessibility_models/heart/results_fold01_heart_DeepSTARR_rep1/Model \
  -o Sequences_example

```

Where:
* -s FASTA file with input 1,001 bp DNA sequences
* -m model file (from accessibility or enhancer activity model)
* -o output directory

We recommend using the models from the different folds and average the prediction scores for a more robust prediction.
