## DeepSTARR-Mouse
DeepSTARR‑Mouse is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) adapted from the previously published DeepSTARR architecture (Nature Genetics, 2022). This model is designed for use in a transfer‑learning framework to predict enhancer activity in E11.5 mouse embryos. For each tissue, CNNs are pre‑trained on DNA accessibility data (i.e., ATAC‑seq) and fine‑tuned on a limited set of experimentally validated enhancers (VISTA enhancer browser, https://enhancer.lbl.gov/vista/).

This repository contains the code used to to train the models, make predictions and design tissue-specific enhancers by Ledidi (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.22.650035v1).

## Sequence-to-accessibility Model training
Data were used for Sequence-to-accessibility model training are uploaded at HuggingFace (https://huggingface.co/datasets/Shenzhi-Chen/DeepSTARR-Mouse-dataset/accessibility_model_dataset).
To train models across 3 Cross-validation folds for 3 tissues (heart, limb and midbrain(CNS))and evaluate them, download the training data (accessibility_model_dataset), run following script:
```
Accessibility_model_training/Run_models.sh
```

This script will train 2 replicates for each 3 Cross-validation folds of 3 tissues and you will get 18 models in sum, for each of them this scripts will make predictions and compute nucleotide contribution scores on held-out test dataset.

Outputs are speprately saved, as cross-validation fold 1 and replicate 1 for heart as a example, all outputs is saved under accessibility_model/heart/results_fold01_heart_DeepSTARR_rep1.

## Sequence-to-activity Model training
Data were used for Sequence-to-activity model training are uploaded at HuggingFace (https://huggingface.co/datasets/Shenzhi-Chen/DeepSTARR-Mouse-dataset/tree/main/enhancer_activity_model_dataset). Data were used for evaluation model are uploaded at HuggingFace (https://huggingface.co/datasets/Shenzhi-Chen/DeepSTARR-Mouse-dataset/tree/main/testing_dataset).
To train models across 3 Cross-validation folds for 3 tissues (heart, limb and midbrain(CNS))and evaluate them, download the training data (enhancer_activity_model_dataset), run following script:
```
Enhancer_activity_model_training/Run_models.sh
```

This script will train 2 replicates for each 3 Cross-validation folds of 3 tissues and you will get 18 models in sum, for each of them this scripts will make predictions and compute nucleotide contribution scores on held-out test dataset.

## Control model training
To compare with transfer learing, we applied two alternatives:
(i) models trained directly on annotated VISTA enhancers without pre‑training.
(ii) predictions from the sequence‑to‑accessibility models (scaled to [0, 1] and used as activity predictions).		
run following script:
```
Model_evaluation/run_control_models.sh
```
(i) As cross-validation fold 1 and replicate 1 directly trained model for heart as an example, is saved under enhancer_activity_model/heart/results_fold01_heart_DeepSTARR_rep1_init_random:
```
enhancer_activity_model/heart/results_fold01_heart_DeepSTARR_rep1_init_random

# Trained model

- Model.h5 # Trained model weights

# Predictions on held-out test dataset

```

(ii) As cross-validation fold 1 and replicate 1 trained model for heart as an example, prediction from the sequence‑to‑accessibility model is saved under accessibility_model/heart/results_fold01_heart_DeepSTARR_rep1:

## Ledidi tissue specific enhancer design
For each tissue, 1,200 random DNA sequences were generated with dinucleotide frequencies matched to VISTA sequences and used as input for Ledidi, a model‑guided gradient optimization approach (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.22.650035v1). To limit the number and magnitude of edits, the edit‑penalty parameter was set to 0.1. Seed sequences were then optimized using both the sequence‑to‑accessibility and sequence‑to‑activity models, with target predicted values set to 12 and 14, respectively. For activity optimization, the final sigmoid layer was removed and pre‑sigmoid logits were used to avoid gradient saturation and improve optimization stability. The reference sequences, which used to adjust dinucleotide frequencies were uploaded at HuggingFace (https://huggingface.co/datasets/Shenzhi-Chen/DeepSTARR-Mouse-dataset/tree/main/testing_dataset). Run following script:
```
Ledidi_enhancer_design/run_ledidi_enhancer_design.sh
```
This script apply trained 2 replicates for each 3 Cross-validation folds of 3 tissues model to design tissue specific enhancer. This script will randomly generate DNA sequences, and optimize both DNA accessibility and enhancer activity for targeted tissue, in each batch it will generate 20 sequences from single model to save memory usage and there are 10 batch, in sum this scripts will design 1,200 sequences for each tissue.

Outputs are speprately saved, as cross-validation fold 1 and replicate 1 for heart model batch 1 design as a example, designed sequences is saved under ledidi_design/heart/results_fold01_heart_DeepSTARR_rep1/1
```
